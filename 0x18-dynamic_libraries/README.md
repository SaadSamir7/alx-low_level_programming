# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

## Project Description

This project aims to enhance your understanding of dynamic libraries in the C programming language and their usage. You will learn what dynamic libraries are, how they work, how to create them, and how to use them. Additionally, you will gain knowledge about the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, its usage, and the differences between static and shared libraries. The project also covers basic usage of tools like `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it.
- What is the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it.
- What are the differences between static and shared libraries.
- Basic usage of `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig.

## Requirements

### C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file

### Bash
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- All your files must be executable
